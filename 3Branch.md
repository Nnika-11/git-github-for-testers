## Practice
You can either work in the previous repository or create a new one.
I intentionally removed some instructions in between, such as switches between branches and commits - keep attention and watch for messages from Git - it will prompt you if something is wrong.

1. Create a new branch named new-branch and switch to it.
2. In the new branch, create a txt file and write down the commands you used to create and switch branches.
3. Commit the changes.
4. Merge the main branch into new-branch.
5. Create another branch named another-branch using a different command.
6. In the new branch, write down in the txt file (which was created in the new-branch) the new commands you used to create another-branch.
7. In the main branch, create a file named bugfix.txt.
8. Merge the main branch and another-branch.
