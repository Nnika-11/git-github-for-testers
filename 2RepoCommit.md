Change Vim to any core.editor of your choice - 
[instruction](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup#_editor)

## Practice

1. Create a new project(IntelliJ,PyCharm) or just folder (VS Code) named "GitPractice".
2. Initialize a new Git repository inside the project (*make sure you are not inside another Git repository!*).
3. If it hasn't been automatically created, create a **.gitignore** file and add all service files that were created with the project.
4. Create a new folder within the project named: "TypesOfTesting".
5. Inside the folder, create two **.txt** files with your favorite types of testing (or you can name them type1.txt, type2.txt).
6. Create a commit that includes all the empty files. The message should be "create files of favorite test types".
7. Write down the definition of your chosen type of testing in each of the files (if you don't have time, you can just type a couple of words)
8. Create a new commit that includes **ONLY** changes from one .txt file. Think about what message you will write.
9. Create a new commit that includes **ONLY** changes from the second .txt file. Think about what message you will write.
10. Add the line "That's my favorite of favorites test type" to one of the files.
11. In the **other** file, change the definition to something else (usually, you can find several similar definitions plus you can take it from ISTQB).
12. Make a commit that includes changes in **BOTH** files. The message should be "edit existed test type files" (not a very good message, come up with a better one - I don't mind).
13. Use the command git log --oneline

Your response should be your 4 commits. Press **q** to exit the log
